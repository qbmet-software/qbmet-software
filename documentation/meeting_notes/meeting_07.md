## 5. 📅 Next Steps
- [ ] **Control Team**  A good first project could be designing/testing a simple PID for user input/hardcoded set points. Just go off motor encoder information no need to use the MPU.

- [ ] **Modeling** 

- [ ] **Sensor Integration** Understand the hardware we have for sensors, (what are the pins on the MPU, what is the MUX for, how does it encode data, how do we interpret it?) 

- [ ] **PM and CTO stuff** Document the code base, what were the short commings (of code) last year? (Still none to my knowledge) Make a master overview presentation.

- **Next Meeting:** Play with the new single link system. Start wireless project. Everyone else work on their projects.
